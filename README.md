### Little about me as a web developer:
</br>
** Courses-holic ** After a decision to change my career to web development, compleadted multiple courses to gain the knowledge and confidence to write good quality (and working!) code. Learning online has thought me self-discipline, searching for additional explanations on MDN or Stackoverflow if some of the parts weren't quite clear at the beginnig, and using * documentation * in new to me libaries :wink: .
