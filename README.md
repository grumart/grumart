### Little about me as a web developer:
</br>
<b>Courses-holic</b> After a decision to change my career to web development, completed multiple courses to gain the knowledge and confidence to write good quality (and working!) code. Learning online has thought me self-discipline, searching for additional explanations on MDN or Stackoverflow if some of the parts weren't quite clear at the beginning, and using * documentation * in new to me libraries :wink: . </br></br>
<b>Fascinated by the power of JavaScript</b> We all love and admire beautifully designed web pages or apps. We all do. But there is nothing better than functionality that actually works and gives you the desired output. Either ordering something online, getting geolocation, connecting to database - that's the true magic. Together with React, this will be my main focus in upcoming career :woman_technologist: . </br></br>
<b>Never-ending learing journey</b> That was the main factor which has drawn me to this industry. Self-development. There is always something new to learn, another language, getting familiar with a package or library. Maybe back-end someday? Who knows! :brain: </br></br>

### If you have come this far, you must like it! Thank you for that! I'm ready to obtain a profesional experience, so if you'd like me on your team, please let me know! :bowtie:
